# README

There I described what I've done, why and how.
So, I spend 9 hours on that work (I working through kanbanflow, I have board, so I know exactly how much time I spend for one or another task).
It was a little bit complicated than I thought.

I wrote a lot of TODO in a model and there a lot of work about refactoring and move some functionality in another class, and I will continue doing this task, cause it is really interesting.
But for now, I have a really raw result. I understand it but still send you my decision because I feel bad cause you waiting so long time.

For the next link we can get some information about downloading process:

But unfortunately, it still does not work properly. It still works in progress.

Thank you for your attention.
